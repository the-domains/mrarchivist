  The concepts of Original Sin and privilege are identical except that they
  operate in different moral universes. In familiar religions, Original Sin is
  something you're born with. It's something you can't escape. It's something
  you can't really do anything about - except be ashamed. It's something you
  should confess and try to cleanse yourself of.
